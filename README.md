# ROT-encrypter
Simple ROT encrypter / decrypter i made for a pentesting challenge.

For extended use it can be customizes as necsesarry. 
In my case i needed to decrypt this string: 
	"Va beqre gb trarengr gur vaivgr pbqr, znxr n CBFG erdhrfg gb /ncv/vaivgr/trarengr"
Which is the reason i added the specialcases in the decryption function for handling '/', ' ' and ','
This can be done as needed
