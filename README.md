# ROT-encrypter
Simple ROT encrypter / decrypter i made for a pentesting challenge.

For extended use it can be customized as requried.
In my case i needed to decrypt this string: 
	"Va beqre gb trarengr gur vaivgr pbqr, znxr n CBFG erdhrfg gb /ncv/vaivgr/trarengr"
Which is the reason i added the specialcases, in the decryption function, for handling '/', ' ' and ','
Customization as such can be made as needed.
